Read `BUILD.md` and output the current database schema — the full SQL for all tables and indexes exactly as defined in the Stage 1 schema section.

Then list any columns that have been added or modified in later stages (e.g. `stop_loss`, `take_profit` added in Stage 4, `push_token` added in Stage 7).

Finally, show the complete up-to-date schema as it should exist after all stages completed so far.
