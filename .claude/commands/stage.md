We are on **Stage $ARGUMENTS** of the build plan.

1. Read `BUILD.md` and find Stage $ARGUMENTS — read the goal, tasks, packages, env vars, and deliverable carefully.
2. Read `CLAUDE.md` to refresh the engineering rules before writing any code.
3. Read any existing files in the relevant `internal/` packages before modifying them.
4. Implement only what is in scope for Stage $ARGUMENTS. Do not build ahead into future stages.
5. When done, verify the deliverable described in BUILD.md Stage $ARGUMENTS works as specified.
6. Update the "Current Stage" line in `CLAUDE.md` to reflect the completed stage.
